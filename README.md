Time Tracker
=============

This allows you to easily invalidate the computation of a reactive function based on a date or time from now.

##Usage
```
TimeTracker.changeIn(1000);
```
or

```
TimeTracker.changeAt(someDate);
```

Checkout the [example](https://github.com/DispatchMe/meteor-time-tracker/tree/master/example).
